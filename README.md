# GoodData Map Integrations

- [MapBox](./mapbox_webpack/README.md)
- MapTiler

The main directory is controlled by nvm: `nvm use`

Each sub folder comes with a different type of map integration based on:
- Vite.js framework v5
- Typescript v 5
- React v18.2

All of the content is decoupled - you have to copy .env files and fill with proper variables 
```shell
cp .env.template .env
```
